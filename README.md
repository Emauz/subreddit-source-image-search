# subreddit-image-scraper
Download media from the "top posts of all time" for each subreddit.  
 
### Calling
**command line --**  
``python {main.py} {count} {data}``  
``{main.py}`` => the file path to main.py  
``{count}`` => the amount of posts to traverse starting from the top of all time, going downward count  
``{data}`` =>  a file path to a text file containing a list of subreddits delimited by a comma and space, or just those subreddits delimited by comma and spaces  
  
e.g. ``python main.py 20 scorpion, astrophotography, birdpics``  
Download the top 20 pictures from /r/scorpion, /r/astrophotography, and /r/birdpics  
  
**OR**  
  
**interactive --**  
``python {main.py}``  
Prompts will come up for the same arguments as the commandline to be filled out in exactly the same way.

### Usage notes  
The output directory is hard set in tools.py, you'll have to change this until I change it later to be a setting. All subreddits in your list will have a folder created here and any media from those subreddits will be downloaded into those folders.
